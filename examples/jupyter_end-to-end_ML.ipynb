    "## 1. Look at the big picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Airborne magnetic anomaly navigation (MagNav) is an emerging technology that can be used for aerial navigation in case GPS is not available. MagNav uses maps of variations in the magnetic field originating from the crust of the Earth. A navigation algorithm compares onboard measurements of the magnetic field with a magnetic anomaly map, which (combined with inertial measurements), produces an estimate of the aircraft position.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's a catch! The magnetometers on the aircraft measure the total magnetic field, which is comprised of multiple magnetic fields arising from not only the crust, but also the Earth's core, diurnal variations, and the aircraft itself. In order to use the crustal anomaly field for MagNav, the other contributions to the total magnetic field must be removed. Magnetic models and base station measurements suffice to remove the core and diurnal fields, which leaves the aircraft field to remove. Unlike the other contributions, the aircraft field is difficult to isolate. Aeromagnetic compensation is used to identify and remove the aircraft field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard approach for aeromagnetic compensation, known as the Tolles-Lawson model, uses a physics-based linear model of the aircraft field combined with data taken during a specific flight pattern designed to maximize the contribution arising from the aircraft. Tolles-Lawson works well when the aircraft field is small compared to the Earth's core field, for example when the magnetometer is located on a boom (stinger) behind the aircraft (Mag 1) but falls short for magnetometers located in the cabin (Mags 2-5).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to perform aeromagnetic compensation using the in-cabin sensors. In addition to the scalar magnetometers (Mags 2-5), which detect the magnitude of the total magnetic field, there are measurements from vector magnetometers (Flux A-D), which detect the three cartesian components of the total magnetic field. There are also measurements available from additional sensors, notably current sensors. Performance is measured using the standard deviation of the error between the predicted values and the professionally-compensated stinger magnetometer."
