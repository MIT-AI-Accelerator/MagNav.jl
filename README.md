MagNav.jl contains a full suite of tools for airborne **Mag**netic anomaly **Nav**igation (MagNav), including flight path & INS data import or simulation, mapping, aeromagnetic compensation, and navigation. The package has been tested on the long-term support (LTS) and latest stable versions of Julia, which may be downloaded from [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/). The recommended IDE for Julia is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with the Julia extension).

**Note:** This package was developed as part of the [DAF-MIT Artificial Intelligence Accelerator](https://aia.mit.edu/), and this specific project has concluded. Only minimal changes will be made moving forward for package maintenance.

## Installation

From the Julia REPL, run:

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("MagNav")
```

or from the Julia REPL, type `]` to enter Pkg REPL mode and run:

```julia-repl
pkg> add MagNav
```

or clone/download the MagNav.jl repo and from within the local MagNav.jl folder, run:

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.activate(".")
julia> Pkg.instantiate()
```

**Note:** If an artifact produces a hash mismatch error while downloading, navigate to the 
local `.julia/artifacts` folder and manually set the appropriate artifact folder name. For example, the `ottawa_area_maps` artifact folder name should be `eb8d8339b55fb4b9b070eda7f3aede970ab53629`. If needed, artifacts can also be downloaded directly from their online storage locations, then unzipped, renamed, and placed in the 
local `.julia/artifacts` folder. Online storage locations (`url`) and folder names (`git-tree-sha1`) can be found in the [Artifacts.toml](Artifacts.toml) file.

## Usage

For general usage, run:

```julia
julia> using MagNav
```

### Examples

Multiple example Jupyter and Pluto notebooks are in the [`examples`](examples) folder. Jupyter can be run directly in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with the Jupyter extension). To start Pluto in a web browser, run:

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("Pluto") # as necessary
julia> using Pluto
julia> Pluto.run()
```

In Pluto, select and open the desired Pluto notebook, then click `Run notebook code` if it does not run automatically.

### Docker

A Docker image is available, which contains Julia, MagNav.jl, and the example notebooks. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), search and pull `jtaylormit/magnav`, and run with the host port set to `8888`. Alternatively, from the command line, run:

```
docker pull jtaylormit/magnav
docker run -p 8888:8888 jtaylormit/magnav
```

A Docker container will spin up and provide a URL that then must be opened in a local browser, which will launch JupyterLab. It will look something like this: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=###`. Jupyter notebooks can be opened directly, but for Pluto notebooks, click `Pluto Notebook` from the Launcher, then select and open the desired Pluto notebook. Note that any changes to the notebooks occur inside the Docker container only, so a notebook must be manually downloaded to be saved.

The above Docker image is [hosted on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jtaylormit/magnav), and it is manually and sporadically updated. For the most recent Docker image, from the command line, run:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/mit-ai-accelerator/magnav.jl
docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/mit-ai-accelerator/magnav.jl
```

## Data

Publicly available flight data can be automatically downloaded within the package itself. This dataset can also be directly downloaded from [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4271803). See the [datasheet](readmes/datasheet_sgl_2020_train.pdf) for high-level information about this dataset. Details of the flight data are described in the readme files within the [`readmes`](readmes) folder.
